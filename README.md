# React

This repository is meant to be a sort of journal, to help me write and further understand this powerful technology.

If you find this, I hope it helps you understand it as well

## Simple Time App

This app is meant to just play with updating the dom

Simply, I start out with saving the DOM root to a variable. I then created a function to display the current time. After which I then set an interval to update the time every second

## Components and Props

This is a simple name display app that takes a user input and renders it

This helps demonstrate how props and components work

Components can be functional or class-based. Which means if we did a class for the component, we could initiate the class and extend the React.Component parent class. If we wanted to do a funciton, we could simply pass "props" as an argument
and get the same outcome
